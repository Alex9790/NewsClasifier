# NewsClasifier
A Data Mining Project, it clasify a News webpage in different Catogories.
I made this for Data Mining Subject.

<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Access any news website you like, https://www.bbc.com/mundo, for example.</li>
<li>Choose a News you like</li>
<li>Now "Save as" that page(.html) in your Desktop or any folder you want in your PC</li>
<li>Execute the program "ClasificadorPaginasWebNoticias.jar"</li>
<li>Press "Subir Archivo" button, and look for the webpage you just downloaded.</li>
<li>Press "Clasificar" and it will show you the category of the webpage you chose.</li>
</ul>

<p>If i remember well it classifies 70% of the instances correctly.</p>
